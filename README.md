# Hello, 🖋📜


We will be presenting the final project for the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Through this project, we use artificial intelligence to convert textual poetry into a multimedia experience of generated images and background audio. 🎨🔊

We are trying to explore Arabic poetry and shed light on its aesthetics and artistic depth in an innovative and engaging way.

first you should get the data from 
To achieve this, we will:

1. 💻 Install and set up the necessary AI libraries for generating images and audio, such as OpenAI and ElevenLabs, and you will find the data along with the main  file in Github.
2. 🔌 Prepare the application programming interfaces (APIs) to properly interact with these libraries.
3. 🎨🔊 Utilize these APIs to generate the appropriate images and audio for the Arabic poetry, and you may also need huggingface tikonizer API.
4. 📽️ Integrate the multimedia elements (images and audio) into a cohesive experience, synchronizing the image display with the audio playback.
5. 🎉Present this integrated poetic multimedia experience and emphasize the value it adds to Arabic poetry arts.
